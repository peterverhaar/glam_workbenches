This tool offers a visual interface that can be used to build simple SPARQL queries. Although this service is limited in making SPARQL queries, it can be helpful if you do not have a lot of experience yet with building SPARQL queries. \n",

    "Another service offered by WikiData is the **query service** accessible via https://query.wikidata.org/. The Wikidata Query Service offers opportunities for building SPARQL queries and downloading the requested data in various file formats (including JSON and CSV). It is also possible to view the data in different data visualizations, like a table, a bar chart or a timeline.  \n",
